**Seeking Comments on XACML Evolution** The TC currently is soliciting comments from the community on evolution and potential reworking of core elements of the XACML specification. As reflected by the variety of open issues in this repository, the scope of possible changes is substantial. The TC continues to believe that the core of the XACML model remains one of the most expressive and robust approaches to access control. However, we recognize opportunities to enhance its efficiency, flexibility, and alignment with modern development practices and use cases. The TC is actively seeking community input to inform this work. In particular, we welcome your thoughts on:

* **Missing functionality** that you believe should be included
* **Redundant or overly complex features** that may warrant deprecation or simplification
* **Areas where more (or less) structure or capability** would be beneficial
* **Developer experience** improvements for integration, tooling, or implementation
